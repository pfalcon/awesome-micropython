Awesome MicroPython
===================

</p>

[MicroPython](https://micropython.org) came known as a "Python for
microcontrollers". It's far more than that.

MicroPython is a full-stack language, which, unlike many other languages,
is concerned not only with scaling up, but also with scaling down. This
means it can run on your laptop, desktop, on a supercomputer (sure, why
not), but also inside your Internet router, fridge, clock, smartwatch,
temperature sensor, microcontroller development board, inside your new
game or productivity app, and in gazillion of other applications and
devices. Familiar, easy to use, expressive language everywhere, with
the ability to optimize your software based on the hardware needs.

Summing this all up with the (unoffical) motto: **MicroPython runs everywhere!**

Forks and Variants
==================

Notable Forks
-------------

There are more than 2000 forks of MicroPython on Github, and here are
a few notable ones:

* [Pycopy](https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy) -
by [@pfalcon](https://github.com/pfalcon/), 2nd largest (~35%) contributor
to MicroPython. Dedicated to further developing all the great features which
were initially contributed to the mainline - stream I/O interface, async
support, memory-saving APIs, etc. Also to optimizations, bugfixes and improved
documentation. Synced with the mainline.
* [Pycom MicroPython](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-micropython-sigfox) -
by [@pycom](https://github.com/pycom/). Support for modern communication
standards like LoRa, Sigfox, etc.
* [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) -

of C libraries are wrapped.

OS/RTOS Ports/Forks

important MicroPython target, alone supporting thousands of diverse computer
and device types, ranging from supercomputers to a few-dollar appliances.
* Windows - part of the mainline. Runs on different Windows variants, from
Server down to Windows IoT.

port to UEFI (BIOS replacement framework) by Intel
([ANN](https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2018/03/08/implementing-micropython-as-a-uefi-test-framework)).

Hardware-specific Forks
-----------------------

Documentation
=============

* [README](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/README.md) -
  Never to miss the project README, it's an entry to the MicroPython universe.
* [Pycopy docs](http://pycopy.readthedocs.io/) are more complete -
  Online searchable documentation for language aspects and builtin modules.
* [Mainline docs](http://docs.micropython.org/) lag in updates.
* [CPython 3.5 docs](https://docs.python.org/3.5/) - MicroPython is an
  implementation of the Python language, so main Python docs provide
  the relevant background information (MicroPython's own docs concentrate
  on differences with CPython and new features added.)

Tools
=====

Accessing MicroPython Prompt (REPL)
-----------------------------------

* Local access: MicroPython comes with REPL (read-evaluate print loop,
interactive prompt), which you can access right in your terminal, or by
connecting over UART (serial) or USB to another device.
* Remote access:
  * Telnet - available for some ports (e.g. CC3200), 3rd-party libraries
    for other ports.
  * WebREPL - REPL in your browser using Websockets! Official client:
    http://micropython.org/webrepl/ . Can be
    [deployed locally](https://github.com/micropython/webrepl/).

Shells
------

There're shells which run directly on a MicroPython device (or in a MicroPython
process), and ones whict run on a host and connect to a device:

On device:
* [upysh](https://pypi.org/project/pycopy-upysh/) - very minimal file
  shell using Python syntax, suitable for devices even with little memory.
  [Part](https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy-lib/tree/master/upysh)
  of pycopy-lib.
* [upy-shell](https://github.com/dhylands/upy-shell) - simple command line
  based shell.

On host:
* [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell) - remote shell for MicroPython.
* [mpfshell](https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell) - simple shell based file
  explorer for Micropython based devices.
* [ampy](https://github.com/adafruit/ampy) - utility to interact with a
  MicroPython board over a serial connection.

Package Management
------------------

* Packages are distributed via [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/search/?q=micropython),
  like packages for any other Python implementation.
* Installable using [upip](https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy-lib#usage)
  package manager (built into Unix port and some other ports with
  networking capabilities, part of pycopy-lib otherwise).
* Documentation of [MicroPython package usage](https://pycopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/packages.html)
  * For non-networked ports, packages can be "cross-installed" on a host,
    and copied to device (manually or using host-side shells above).
  * For ultimate RAM efficiency, packages can be "frozen" into MicroPython
    binary.
